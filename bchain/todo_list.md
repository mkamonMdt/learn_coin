- [ ] [5600a9c](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/5600a9cc0fb592f28ae2a38488849b7d272c9ef2)|| Implement slashing mechanism 
- [ ] [8244cad](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/8244cade376cbd176ba06bb9b111d41b51375a3c)||  Validators are still selected with O(n^2) complexity as in each slot we traverse almost entire blockchain. We should calculate validators once after adding last block of epoch N-2 and store them localy for ongoing operation purposes.
- [ ] [8244cad](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/8244cade376cbd176ba06bb9b111d41b51375a3c)|| There is no need to traverse entire blockchain history every epoch to calculate validators. More efficient approach might be to keep track of relevant stake_pool, and update it epoch-by-epoch.
