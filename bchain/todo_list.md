- [ ] [5dd147b](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/5dd147ba85d703739c75d92bda12171b72e8cdd4)|| Move Wallets state managing logic to wallets module. 
- [ ] [5dd147b](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/5dd147ba85d703739c75d92bda12171b72e8cdd4)|| Need Wallets logic that allows to "reserve&collect" fees until operation (especially in other than-wallet related transaction types) is concluded. It is not trivial as Transaction fees should be collected only for valid transaction but rules for failure in executing a contract probably needs a fee collection nevertheless.
- [ ] [5dd147b](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/5dd147ba85d703739c75d92bda12171b72e8cdd4)|| Blochchain has public member Wallets used in pseudo "integration" tests with contracts in main crate. In general we need to explcitly extend the interface with a trait that allows to get single Wallet by user ID. 
- [ ] [8dd99c7](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/8dd99c7e88a1932122b8ab85156fb19fa56e5586)|| stake_pool is explict String-key HashMap
- [ ] [8dd99c7](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/8dd99c7e88a1932122b8ab85156fb19fa56e5586)|| Validators for given epoch are kept as Vec<String> althugh the
length of the container cannot be changed (at the moment) 
- [ ] [8dd99c7](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/8dd99c7e88a1932122b8ab85156fb19fa56e5586)|| current_epoch validators are return so that the vec can be iterated, maybe some interator implementation or use(Fn(Validator)) could improve the design
- [ ] [8dd99c7](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/8dd99c7e88a1932122b8ab85156fb19fa56e5586)|| update_validators repeatedly perform seed.clone() for all validators
- [ ] [69ff4a8](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/69ff4a8ed3cedd3cc5f4edd26bfa47c367a0e753)|| String are widely used in place of const-in-lenght hash. The better way would be to use some stack-held container like an array. The problem will arrise if hash function would be upgraded. Can be sloved with enum wrapping versioning but requires more analysis. 
- [ ] [16febf1](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/16febf1060e7e75621c5849085a88d8a247b35c2)|| Patricia-Merkle-Tire is based on wallets' internal hash map, can it be made container-independent? 
- [ ] [16febf1](https://github.com/mkamonMdt/learn_coin/commit/16febf1060e7e75621c5849085a88d8a247b35c2)|| Patricia-Merkle-Tire mod: Tests, improve code structure, prepare documentation 
- [ ] [954ffc2](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/954ffc26e38611ad57fc77fb2a36f769cdec77cb)|| Opcodes are fun, can we make them binary-compatible?
- [ ] [954ffc2](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/954ffc26e38611ad57fc77fb2a36f769cdec77cb)|| Contract interface should be external to BChain, maybe trait?
- [ ] [954ffc2](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/954ffc26e38611ad57fc77fb2a36f769cdec77cb)||  Nasty u64->2xu32 pointer handling
- [ ] [5600a9c](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/5600a9cc0fb592f28ae2a38488849b7d272c9ef2)|| Implement slashing mechanism 
- [ ] [50d88b9](https://github.com/mkamonmdt/learn_coin/commit/50d88b94a100bd8e5db414b2191951020a162d57)|| comparision between floats should be done involving epsilon

More efficient approach might be to keep track of relevant stake_pool, and update it epoch-by-epoch.

The users cannot withdraw. Mostlikely stakes should be put on specific Epoch(s), returned after some time.

We should calculate validators once after adding last block of epoch N-2 and store them localy for ongoing operation purposes.
